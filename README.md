# Payroll Calculation using OOP

Context

Payroll System of any organisation calculates the amount the organisation owe to its employees based on various factors such as the time and the number of days they worked, their hourly wages or commission rate, and whether they took leave during the pay period. The system determines the gross pay by evaluating taxes and other deductions. On the payroll date, the system provides the employees with the details of payroll deposits in the form of a pay slip.
